# Jotai X React: Practicing state management in React with Jotai

## About
Dedicating this repository to learning and experimenting with Jotai and React! With this repository, I'm exploring the power of Jotai for state management, and sharing my journey with others who are also looking to learn and improve their skills on my hashnode blog.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- React 
- Jotai
- CSS

##  Lesson Learned :)
Jotai is Awesome! Especially if you really don't want to use complex state management libraries. I have documented my entire experience, which I'll soon attach to this ReadMe. Meanwhile, please visit my [hashnode blog](https://forjessicasake.hashnode.dev/).
